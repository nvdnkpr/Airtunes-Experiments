# TIAirtunesReceiver
### Let's you stream audio data to an Airport Express (in theory)

The limited control stuff needed to get connected works, but actually streaming the audio doesn't, yet.

## TODO

- Write ALAC encoding method
- Add support for password protected expresses
- Add support for timing packets


## Usage

See the "AirtunesServer" app to see what I've got so far.

## ARC?

No, fuck ARC.
